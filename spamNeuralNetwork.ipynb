So our initial results will likely involve an input layer defined with 57 nodes to match the number of our features, and first hidden layer with 28 or so nodes. I think it might be better for our hidden layers to have a progressively smaller amount of nodes per level, which would mean that there will need to be aggregation of the results in previous layers. It might make sense then to go through the list of features and consider which ones may indicate an email is more likely to be spam and not spam (or neutral) and we can group our layers and nodes that way, and the result will be more effective."]},{"metadata":{"id":"cPUtP2HZQbom","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Creating and Running the Network
